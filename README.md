# Expanding Text Experiment

![](/images/screenshot.png)

This repo is an experiment in both telescopic text (also known as StretchText) and progressive summarization. While reading the paper, "How Bodies Matter: Five Themes for Interaction Design," instead of taking notes I wrote short summaries of each section along the way and compiled them into this HTML page where you can expand the paper from my condensed summaries up to the full text of the paper.

The goal of this experiment is to see whether telescopic text proves to be useful on larger scales when applied to a piece of text many pages in length. Does this make it easier to quickly grasp or understand the concepts? Does this make it easier for myself to come back and review the paper at a later time?

The process of progressive summarization from the writing perspective is somewhat akin to being given flashcards at the end of every section. It forces you to pay more attention as you read and to really reflect on the key points and ideas. While it takes much longer to read this way, it also leaves you (I believe) with a greater and longer-lasting understanding of the text, as well a set of summaries which could be useful to help kickstart other's understanding of the same material.

If this experiment proves to be a success then I hope to build an interface to make the process of authoring and sharing these expanding-text documents many magnitudes easier.
